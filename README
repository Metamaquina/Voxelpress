Dependencies, as best I can recall:

python-daemon
python-gudev
python-dbus




System setup instructions:

1) This is only tested so far with Arduino Megas + Ramps board.
Sanguino based controllers are known to not work currently with
Voxelpress.

2) Make sure you have the ability to access usb serial ports without
having to chmod every time you plug it in in.  In debian, this means
adding your user to the dialout group (requires you to log out and log
back in again).

3) Make sure your printer is not currently plugged in, and don't have
programs like pronterface open.

4) Have slic3r already installed on your system.




Installation instructions, as best I can recall:


0) get repository
> git clone git://github.com/Aeva/voxelpress.git

1) setup the daemon
> cd /wherever/you/saved/the/voxelpress_repository
> cd voxelpress
> mkdir var
> mkdir var/voxelpress
> mkdir etc
> mkdir etc/voxelpress
> ./sbin/vpd.py
# plug your printer in now, and wait a few second until the console
# notes that a new printer is found, then unplug your printer
# ctrl-c

> gedit ./etc/voxelpress/printers/SOME_UUID_STRING.json
# {"filter": "org.slic3r", "config_file": [0, "file", ""]},
# {"filter": "org.slic3r", "config_file": [0, "file", "/path/to/slic3r/profile.ini"]},

# you can also rename your printer here.  Take care that the file is 
# still parseable json when you're done.

# save & close

2) run the daemon and try printing
> ./sbin/vpd.py&
> ./bin/vpp.py list
> ./bin/vpp.py print /path/to/stl/file.stl
